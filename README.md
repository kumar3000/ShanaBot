# ShanaBot
A neural network to model the play calling of Kyle Shanahan.

## Pipeline
- Pre-Process data into one csv with:
    Only 49ers offensive plays from 2017-2024
    Encode categorical values
    Visualize playtype frequency

## Architecture Ideas
- LLM that takes in conditional arguments and outputs a suggested play.
